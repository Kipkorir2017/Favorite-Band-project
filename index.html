    <h2>About Yamoto Band</h2>
    <p id="one">Yamoto Band comprises of four young talented Tanzanian artists;<br>
    <em>Dogo Aslay, Maromboso, Enock Bella and Beka</em>.<br>
    The original name of this acclaimed boy band was ‘Mkubwa na Wanawe’,
    but later the quartete adopted the name of their first single <br>‘Yamoto’ 
    which became a huge hit in Tanzania.
    Previously,<br> each of the seven members of this band was a 
    Bongo Flava artist performing using playback. <br> 
    They came together to form a band and have been playing live music since 2013.<br> 
    In early 2014 they released their second track entitled <br>‘Nitajuta’ followed with ‘Niseme Nisiseme’ in 2015. <br> 
    They were awarded <strong>The Best Band in 2015 at Kilimanjaro Music Awards</strong>.<br>
    They are really beautiful songs and when I listen to them they really make me feel good.<br>
    Unfortunately the Band split up in 2015 and each member is working on solo projects at the moment!
