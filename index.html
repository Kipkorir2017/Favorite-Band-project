    <h2>About Yamoto Band</h2>
    <p>Yamoto Band comprises of four young talented Tanzanian artists;<br>
    <em>Dogo Aslay, Maromboso, Enock Bella and Beka</em>.<br>
    The original name of this acclaimed boy band was ‘Mkubwa na Wanawe’,
    but later the quartete adopted the name of their first single <br>‘Yamoto’ 
    which became a huge hit in Tanzania.
    Previously,<br> each of the seven members of this band was a 
    Bongo Flava artist performing using playback. <br> 
    They came together to form a band and have been playing live music since 2013.<br> 
    In early 2014 they released their second track entitled <br>‘Nitajuta’ followed with ‘Niseme Nisiseme’ in 2015. <br> 
    They were awarded <strong>The Best Band in 2015 at Kilimanjaro Music Awards</strong>.<br>
    They are really beautiful songs and when I listen to them they really make me feel good.<br>
    Unfortunately the Band split up in 2015 and each member is working on solo projects at the moment!

           <p id="two">
            A young man by the name of <em>Siaka Nasor</em>,<br> 
           who is popularly known as Dogo Aslay, <br>
           can probably be called the backbone of Yamoto Band.<br> 
           Even before he joined the group, <br>he had already had a reputation for himself.<br> 
           Dogo is behind some of the best singles of the group, <br>
           including Naenda Kusema Kwa Mama.

              <h4> Maromboso</h4>
              <img class="member" src="images/Mbosso.jpg" alt="Maromboso">
              <p> Back when he was a member of Yamoto Band, 
              Maromboso, whose real name is Mbwana Yusuph Kilungi,<br>
              had been the most stylish one of the group. 
              One of the reasons why the band became so popular was <br>
              probably his impeccable sense of style.

              <h4> Enock Bella</h4>
              <img class="member"src="images/Bella.jpg" alt="Enock Bella">
              <p id="two">
                Out of the four band members, <br> Enock had the most distinct voice.<br> 
                It was a common element of most songs of Yamoto Band,<br> 
                as each song had his vocal stylings right before the climax. 
                Even though Enock ventured into his own solo career,<br>
                Though it was hard for him to overcome the group mentality <br>
                he developed while being a part of the Yamoto Band.
                he is an actor as well as a song writer.

                    <h4>Beka Flavour</h4>
                    <img class="member"src="images/Beka.jpg" alt="Beka Flavour">
                    <p id="two"> Beka was the first person to blame Dogo for the tumult inside the group. <br>
                    He was incredibly displeased with the fact that Aslay went behind everyone’s
                    back and recorded a solo track while still being a part of the group. <br>
                    It seems like Beka can breathe easier now that he is a free man.<br> 
                    He has released several successful singles and continues to win over 
                    the hearts of his fans.<br>
